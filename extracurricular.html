                <h4>Extracurriculars and Hobbies</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout high school, I was in my school's jazz and orchestral 
                    band, where I played tenor saxophone, alto saxophone and piano. 
                    In grade 12, I joined my school's <a href="https://deca.ca/">DECA</a> 
                    team with my friend and made it to Provincials. I also consistently took piano lessons 
                    since I was 5 years old and have placed top 3 in a handful of 
                    local piano competitions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Currently, my interests include playing competitive FPS games 
                    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">Valorant</a>, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_2">Counter Strike 2</a>), 
                    <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12247578">osu!</a>, 
                    music, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Discrete-switch_keyboard">mechanical keyboard modding</a>, 
                    watching anime, PC building, and cycling when the weather is nice. Recently, I have been playing 
                    JRPG games in the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)">Persona series</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honkai:_Star_Rail">Honkai Star Rail</a>. 
                    At TMU I participated in some TMU.gg (TMU Gamer's Guild) events including their 
                    keyboard meetup, where I was a quarter-finalist in their typing competition. I 
                    also actively participate in bootcamps offered by TRSM to strengthen my skills in 
                    various softwares and programming languages.
