    <h3>What am I learning?</h3><hr>

    <h4>A bit about my current program</h4>
    <blockquote>
        My current program is the Business Technology Management (BTM)
        program. This program teaches about the fundamentals of business, 
        technology and management and the skills relevant in pursuit of 
        rapidly growing career paths in those fields, such as Business 
        Intelligence and Information Technology.
    </blockquote>

    <h4>My favourite course</h4>
    <blockquote>
        Among the variety of courses offered in BTM, a personal favourite 
        of mine is
        <strong>ITM618: Business Intelligence and Analytics.</strong> 
        This course put my Python coding skills to the test with 
        the use of the Pandas library to find insights in a real
        data set. As someone looking into pursuing a career in 
        Data Analytics, I believe that the skills I gained in this 
        course will be extremely relevant in my future endeavours.

    <h3>More About Me</h3><hr>

    <h4>What I did/do outside of School</h4>
    <blockquote>
        Throughout high school, I was in my school's jazz and orchestral 
        band, where I played tenor saxophone, alto saxophone and piano. 
        In grade 12, I joined my school's <a href="https://deca.ca/">DECA</a> 
        team with my friend and made it to Provincials. I also consistently took piano lessons 
        since I was 5 years old and have placed top 3 in a handful of 
        local piano competitions.
