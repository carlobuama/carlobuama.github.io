<h3>What I'm learning</h3><hr>

<h4>A bit about my current program</h4>

<div class="intro">
    My current program is the Business Technology Management (BTM)
    program. This program teaches about the fundamentals of business, 
    technology and management and the skills relevant in pursuit of 
    rapidly growing career paths in those fields, such as Business 
    Intelligence and Information Technology.
</div>

<h4>My favourite courses</h4>

<p>Among the various courses I took so far in BTM, here are my top 3:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <span class="coursetitle">ITM618: Business Intelligence and Analytics</span> 
        <p>This course put my Python coding skills to the test with 
        the use of the Pandas library to find insights in a real
        data set. As someone looking into pursuing a career in 
        Data Analytics, I believe that the skills I gained 
        will be extremely relevant in my future endeavours, 
        making this one of the most useful courses I took so far.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <span class="coursetitle">ITM711: Cloud Computing</span> 
            <p>This course was about both the theoretical and practical 
            applications of cloud computing. I really enjoyed doing the labs
            in this course, which included deploying websites and virtual 
            machines using Amazon Web Services.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <span class="coursetitle">ITM301: IT Infrastructure</span> 
            <p>This course was an introductory course about computer
            hardware/software and communication networks. I found this course 
            very interesting as someone fascinated by computer hardware. The 
            software part of it was very practical too.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>More About Me</h3><hr>

<h4>What I did/do outside of School</h4>
<p>
    Throughout high school, I was in my school's jazz and orchestral 
    band, where I played tenor saxophone, alto saxophone and piano. 
    In grade 12, I joined my school's <a href="https://deca.ca/">DECA</a> 
    team with my friend and made it to Provincials. I also consistently took piano lessons 
    since I was 5 years old and have placed top 3 in a handful of 
    local piano competitions.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, my interests include playing competitive FPS games 
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">Valorant</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_2">Counter Strike 2</a>), 
    <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12247578">osu!</a>, 
    music, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Discrete-switch_keyboard">mechanical keyboard modding</a>, 
    watching anime, and PC building. Recently, I have been playing 
    JRPG games in the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)">Persona series</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honkai:_Star_Rail">Honkai Star Rail</a>. 
    At TMU I participated in some TMU.gg (TMU Gamer's Guild) events including their 
    keyboard meetup, where I was a quarter-finalist in their typing competition. I 
    also actively participate in bootcamps offered by TRSM to strengthen my skills in 
    various softwares and programming languages.
